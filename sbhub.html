	<h2>The History of Skateboarding</h2>
	<p class="par"> In the 1950's surfers in California decided that shredding water was no longer enough. They attached roller skate
		wheels to a wooden 2x4 & started surfing the sidewalks. This led the the creation of the skateboard & its widespread popularity throughout the 60's.
		The skateboard itself has seen many physical transitions starting from a rectangle piece of wood to the boards we see today.

	<p class="par"> The popularity of skatebaording rose & fell until 1972 when urethane wheels substituted its much more dangerous clay counterpart. During
		this decade the sport was revolutionized when Alan "Ollie" Gelfand invented a maneuver that opened up endless possibilities for skaters world wide.
		Alan would slam his back foot down on the tail of his board & jump, thereby popping himself & the board into the air. This inturn birthed The Ollie
		which changed the style of skateboarding drastically.
	</p>
	<h2>The Professionals</h2>
	<p class="par"> For years after Gelfand paved the way, many other skaters took to the streets and designed their own stylish way to ride the board.
		Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen & Dylan Rieder are just a few of the many who continued to do the unthinkable on these crazy contraptions. From the 80's
		to this day, skateboarding has developed from a criminal subculture to a sport worthy of recognition in the Olympics and it will continue to grow
		indefinitely. There is no right or wrong way to ride them and that's what keeps the creativity alive, the community strong & the possibilities
		endless. Afterall the invention itself was designed from pure curiousity and innovation; all in the name of fun.
